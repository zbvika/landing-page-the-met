THE MET

Project Description:

This project represents a museum webpage with elements related to schedules, contacts, and various content. The page is adapted for different devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop versions. Animations are used for smooth transitions and visual effects, and some elements are displayed depending on the screen size.

Technologies Used:

1) Sass:

- Variables for colors and sizes ($main-color-red, $main-color-dark, etc.) are used to simplify the maintenance and editing of styles.

- Mixins (@mixin) for styling various elements such as adaptive padding and sizes, as well as adding hover, focus, and active effects.

2) Animations:

- CSS animations are used for smooth effects of elements appearing using @keyframes.

3) Responsive Design:

- Wide support for different screen sizes with the use of the on-tablet and on-desktop mixins.

- The use of CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layout of elements, their alignment, and distribution.

This is a comprehensive approach to creating a webpage with a focus on usability, responsiveness, and visual effects.
